:::note
The Nym Socks5 Client was built in the [building nym](/docs/next/run-nym-nodes/build-nym/) section. If you haven't yet built Nym and want to run the code on this page, go there first.
:::

Many existing applications are able to use the SOCKS5 proxy protocol. If you want to send such an application's traffic through the mixnet, you can use the `nym-socks5-client` to bounce network traffic through the Nym network, like this:

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/docs/nym-socks5-architecture.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/docs/nym-socks5-architecture-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

There are 2 pieces of software that work together to send SOCKS5 traffic through the mixnet: the `nym-socks5-client`, and the `nym-network-requester`. 

The `nym-socks5-client` allows you to do the following from your local machine:
* Take a TCP data stream from a application that can send traffic via SOCKS5. 
* Chop up the TCP stream into multiple Sphinx packets, assigning sequence numbers to them, while leaving the TCP connection open for more data
* Send the Sphinx packets through the mixnet to a [Nym Network Requester](/docs/next/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester). Packets are shuffled and mixed as they transit the mixnet.

The `nym-network-requester` then reassembles the original TCP stream using the packets' sequence numbers, and make the intended request. It will then chop up the response into Sphinx packets and send them back through the mixnet to your  `nym-socks5-client`. The application will then receive its data, without even noticing that it wasn't talking to a "normal" SOCKS5 proxy!


### Viewing command help

You can check that your binaries are properly compiled with:

```
./nym-socks5-client --help
```

You can check the necessary parameters for the available commands by running:

```
./nym-client <command> --help 
```

### Initialising a new client instance

Before you can use the client, you need to initalise a new instance of it, which can be done with the following command:

```
./nym-socks5-client init --id <id> --provider <provider>
```

The `--id` in the example above is a local identifier so that you can name your clients; it is **never** transmitted over the network.

The `--provider` field needs to be filled with the Nym address of a Network Requester that can make network requests on your behalf. If you can't find one from the community, you'll have to [run your own](/docs/next/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester). A nicer way of discovering public Service Providers is incoming, but at the moment just ask around in community channels and someone will give you an address to use. 


### Running the socks5 client

You can run the initalised client by doing this:

```
./nym-socks5-client run --id <id>
```

### Using the socks5 client

After completing the steps above, your local Socks5 Client will be listening on `localhost:1080` ready to proxy traffic to the Network Requester set as the `--provider` when initialising. 

When trying to connect your app, generally the proxy settings are found in `settings->advanced` or `settings->connection`. 

Here is an example of setting the proxy connecting in Blockstream Green:

![Blockstream Green settings](/img/docs/wallet-proxy-settings/blockstream-green.gif)

Most wallets and other applications will work basically the same way: find the network proxy settings, enter the proxy url (host: **localhost**, port: **1080**).

In some other applications, this might be written as **localhost:1080** if there's only one proxy entry field.
