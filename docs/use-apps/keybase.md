You need to [run the Nym Socks5 client](/docs/use-apps/) before following the instructions on this page.

We have added support for KeyBase (which we use for our own internal chat). Feel free to try that out and say hello!

The socks5 settings in KeyBase are under Settings > Advanced > Proxy Settings.
