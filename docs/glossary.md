**[Address](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/integrations/addresses-in-nym/)** - A unique string of characters that is generated and stored in its own public/private keypair locally.

**[Ack](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/architecture/traffic-flow/#acks)** - Short for "acknowledgement". Whenever a hop is completed, the recieving node will send back an 'ack', so that the sending node knows that the packet was recieved.

**[Blockchain](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/smart-contracts/overview/)** - A distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called blocks.

**[Coconut](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/coconut/)** - A distributed cryptographic signing scheme providing a high degree of privacy for its users.

**[CLI](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/nym-cli/)** - A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer.

**Credentials** - Unique values that prove the legitimacy of a user or individual.

**Centralisation** - Refers to the concentration of control of an activity or organisation under a single authority.

**[Delegating NYM](https://medium.com/coinmonks/what-you-have-to-know-about-staking-and-delegating-458b6d2300a5)** - Similar to bonding but by non-operators and as proof of their trust in a node operator providing a good quality of service. 

**Decentralisation** - Refers to the transfer of control and decision-making from a centralised entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network.

**Encryption** - The process of encoding information.

**[Gateways](https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5)** - The entrance to the mixnet that encrypted packets must pass through before being forwarded to mix nodes. They also act as a sort of mailbox for messages.

**[Gateway Bonding](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/gateways/#bonding-your-gateway)** - The action of node operators to bond their stake (in the form of NYM tokens) to a Gateway in order to join the network topology and begin routing traffic through.

**[Metadata](https://www.opendatasoft.com/en/blog/what-is-metadata-and-why-is-it-important-data)** - A set of data that describes and gives information about other data such as IP addresses, device types, geolocations etc.

**[Mixnet](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/architecture/traffic-flow/)** - A routing protocol which encrypts and mixes Sphinx packet traffic so that it cannot be determined who is communicating with whom. 

**[Mix Nodes](https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-mixnodes-deep-dive-d2b91917f097)** - The backbone of the Nym infrastructure, that are organised in a three-layer network referred to as the mixnet that network traffic passes through. It mixes, hides and reorders traffic and are rewarded in NYM tokens for their quality of service.

**[Mix node Bonding](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/mixnodes/#bonding-your-mix-node)** - The action of node operators bonding their stake (in the form of NYM tokens) to a Mix node in order to join the network topology and begin routing traffic through.

**[Network Requester](https://blog.nymtech.net/tech-deepdive-network-requesters-e5359a6cc31c)** - Is a binary that can be ran alongside a Nym Client on a VPS, which allows for private network requests to be made outside the mixnet from you local Nym client

**Nym** - The in-text name of the organisation.

**[Nym Typescript SDK](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/sdk/overview)** - A Typescript software development kit which allows developers to build browser-based Mixnet application.

**[NYM](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/nym-cli/#send-tokens-to-an-account)** - Natively distributed token. 

**[Nym Wallet](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/wallet/)** - The Nym Wallet handles all things regarding handling Nym Tokens about your Nym Node. It is a GUI application that can be downloaded and run on your machine.

**[Nym Technologies SA](https://nymtech.net)** - The official company name.

**[Nyx](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/integrations/payment-integration-overview/)** - A CosmWasm-enabled blockchain smart contracts platform that functions as the backbone of the Nym network, used to keep track and provide the history of the NYM token's transactions.

**Payload** - The carrying capacity of a packet or other transmission data unit.

**Pledge** - The number of tokens that are put up by node operators on their nodes as their commitment to provide good quality of service and insure against future bad behaviour.

**Proof-of-Mixing** - The reward of NYM tokens is based on the good quality of service carried out by node operators.

**Public Key** - A large numerical value that is used to encrypt data.

**SDK** - Stands for Software Development Kit

**Sphinx** - A cryptographic message format used to relay anonymised messages within the mixnet, also used by the Lightning Network or something similar.

**[Socks5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS)** - An proxy protocol that exchanges network packets between a client and server through a proxy server.

**[Service Provider](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/tutorials/nym-simple-websocket-tutorial/)** - Any type of app that can communicate with the mixnet via a Nym Client.

**[Validators](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/validators/)** - Secures the Nyx blockchain with a staking token, defending the network from attacks.

**[VPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server)** - Stands for Virtual Private Server. Its a virtual machine that acts as an isolated virtual environment on a physical server operated by a cloud, web or internet hosting provider.

**Zero Knowledge Proofs** - Cryptographic techniques that make it possible to prove something to be true without having to reveal the evidence.
