title: Build Nyx Apps (coming soon)
---

The [Nyx](https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-now-supports-smart-contracts-2186da46bc7f) blockchain is the Nym Cosmos blockchain used (until now) just to keep track of the mixnet via Webassembly [smart contracts](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/contracts).

Once completed, users will be able to write and upload smart contracts to Nyx utilising our Coconut signature scheme, in order to create privacy enhanced applications (PEAPs). 

More to come here very soon!
